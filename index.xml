create blog locally add content setup github pages add github action to auto deploy update DNS zone enable comments enable share links add meaningful content Not too bad? But how did we arrive here?

Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained and scrapped various personal webpages including weblogs. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for another try. I want to focus my writing here on tech and IT in whatever one may consider to be the professional side - but who am I kidding, a blog is never strictly professional. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes. ðŸ˜‰
The Tech Stack I have some prior experience with both maintaining and running Wordpress blogs.</description></item></channel></rss>
